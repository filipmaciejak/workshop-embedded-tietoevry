## Introduction

In the simplest case the problem is to, given an array of numbers, find all pairs that add up to a given target value. We can also imagine the same problem, but instead of searching for pairs, look for triplets, quadruplets etc.

## Usage

You can build the source code using makefile. Just make sure to go to a folder with solution. Then you can run it manually.

```
cd two_sum
make build
./example
```

You can also build it, run, and clean up at the same time.

```
cd two_sum
make all
```
