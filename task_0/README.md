## Introduction

The problem was to write a structure (char* wrapper) to simplify operations on strings to a single API. That way we don't have to edit arrays manually.

## Usage (Linux)

You can compile the source code and create an executable using the following command.

```
gcc CString.c -o out
```

Now you can run it.

```
./out
```
